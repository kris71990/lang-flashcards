# Language Flashcards

**Author:** Kris Sakarias

**Version** 2.0.0

## Overview

This is a flaschard app that helps people learn useful vocabulary and terminology in various languages. Users can select a language to practice, along with their desired direction of translation, and are presented with a collection of words and useful vocabulary to practice. 

The application is built with a **Node** backend server and API, and manages data with **SQL/PostgreSQL**. The frontend user experience used to be a simplified jQuery implementation, but is in the process of redevelopment with **React** and **Redux** for organizational and scalability reasons. 

## Testing

Unit testing with Jest
